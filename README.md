# Object Detection with YOLO and Darknet

## Description:
This project focuses on implementing object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm with the Darknet framework. Object detection is a critical task in computer vision, and YOLO is known for its real-time performance and accuracy, making it suitable for various applications such as surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and image analysis.

## Features:
- Utilizes Google Colab for cloud-based computing resources.
- Implements YOLO algorithm for real-time object detection.
- Utilizes Darknet framework for model training and deployment.
- Provides an end-to-end methodology for object detection in videos.
- Includes visualization of detected objects with bounding boxes and labels.
- Offers analysis of results including accuracy, speed, and limitations.

## Installation:
1. Clone the Darknet repository: `git clone https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/`
2. Follow the setup instructions provided in the repository for compilation and configuration.
3. Download pre-trained YOLO weights from: https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
4. Ensure necessary dependencies are installed, such as OpenCV and ffmpeg.

## Usage:
1. Upload video files for object detection analysis.
2. Run object detection using the provided commands, specifying input video files and desired confidence thresholds.
3. Visualize results with annotated video outputs highlighting detected objects.
4. Analyze performance metrics such as frames per second (FPS) and mean average precision (mAP).
